### Running the application: Create .env file at /src
---------------------------
An .env file is needed otherwise the application wonâ€™t start. 
The .env file is placed in /src. 
The logic and structure of the .env file is described in the following:

```
RPC_PROVIDER=<https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/<RPCKey>>
PRIVATE_KEY=<PrivateKey>
```

### Architecture and logic of the application
